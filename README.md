concourse Deployments
======================================

This repository acts as an upstream repository of YAML templates for use
in a concourse BOSH deployment, managed via the [Genesis][1] utility.

Creating a new concourse Deployment
======================================

To create a new [Genesis][1] based deployment of concourse, run
`genesis new deployment --template concourse`. This will create a new repo
called `concourse-deployments` for you, and pull in the
`github.com/starkandwayne/concourse-deployment` repo as the `upstream` remote,
copying the contents of `global/*` into the new `concourse-deployments` repo.

This allows you to easily diverge from the upstream templates to suit your
environment, and while also being able to pull in changes from upstream down
the road.

Custom Sites
======================================

To create a new site, run `genesis new site --template <site-type>`. This
will copy in the latest data from the `upstream` remote's `.templates/<site-type>`
directory.
